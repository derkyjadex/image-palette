# Palette

Picks the most prominent colours from an image, eg. album art.

Build with:

  > stack build
 
Run with:

  > stack exec Palette-exe [filename]
 
Should work with most common image formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.).

It will print out the colours starting with the most prominent first. It will also create `output.css`. Open `test.html` to see the results!
